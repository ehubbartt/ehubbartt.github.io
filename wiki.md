# Telecaster vs Stratocaster guitars

## What are the differences between a Telecaster and a Stratocaster?

**Telecaster** and **Stratocaster** are two different types of electric guitars. Both are very similar to each other in a lot of ways but to the trained ear there is a very *big difference*. The easiest way to tell the difference between the guitars is by the appearance of them.

The following image is of a telecaster guitar:

As you can see the pick-guard has a flat edge on the bottom and the knobs on the side are vertically aligned. There is also typically only one pickup on these guitars which is one of the reasons that the guitar has such a unique *twangy* sound to them.

The following image is of a stratocaster guitar:

As you can see the pick-guard has a curved edge and the knobs are not aligned with each other. Statocaster guitars have multiple pickups which allows you to change the sound of the guitar more which makes them a bit more versatile. Stratocaster guitars are the most popular form of electric guitar and are great for beginners that are trying to get into playing electric guitar.

### What is my personal favorite?

Right now I have been mainly playing on my new G&L stratocaster

Here is a picture of it:

I got this used at a local music shop called *The Trading Musician* and I have been loving it. It has a great sound and is very easy to play. I would highly recommend this guitar to anyone that is looking for a good starter guitar.
